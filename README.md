# Disease_Detection
### This model compares the accuracy of predicting 42 categories of diseases with 132 parameters using softmax regression on a dataset of 5000 trianing examples 
### 1) Artifical Neural Network : 97.62%
### 2) Random Forest Algorithm: 97.5% 
Note: This accuracy is on training data, both of these algorithms return 100% accuracy in test dataset which is much smaller than Training dataset
